# Comparison of Python Data Manipulation Libraries
This repository contains a comparison of various Python data manipulation libraries, including their features and capabilities. The purpose of this repository is to help users determine which library is the best fit for their needs, based on their specific use case and requirements.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/chiragbajaj25/data-processing-libraries
```

Next, you will need to install the required dependencies using pip.

bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Libraries
This repository contains comparisons between the following Python data manipulation libraries:

- Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis that provides data structures for efficiently storing and processing large datasets.

- NumPy: A library for numerical computing that provides a powerful array data structure and a wide range of mathematical functions.

- Dask: A library for parallel computing and distributed computing that extends the functionality of Pandas and NumPy to larger datasets.

- Vaex: A library for out-of-core data analysis that allows you to work with large datasets that do not fit in memory.

## Comparisons
This repository contains several comparisons between the different libraries. Each comparison is contained in a separate directory and includes a README.md file that provides more details about the comparison.

The following comparisons are included in this repository:

- Performance: A comparison of the performance of the different libraries on a variety of tasks and datasets.

- Functionality: A comparison of the functionality provided by the different libraries, including their data structures, methods, and capabilities.

- Ease of Use: A comparison of the ease of use of the different libraries, including their syntax, documentation, and user interfaces.
